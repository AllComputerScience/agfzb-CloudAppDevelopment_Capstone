# Capstone

The completed project can be found hosted through the IBMCloud Servers here: https://ericcapstone.mybluemix.net/dealership/

This project was built from a forked template consisting of mostly YAML settings to install from IBM Cloud Foundary at the CLI.

Most of the code you find besides the server settings is written by myself (Eric Dee). Similar to starting from a bare Django project.

Some folder functions exist to call a "serverless" API hosted on the IBM Cloud application interface. There may be some hacky solutions,
which were utilized as a workaround for difficult to translate Cloudant documentation.
